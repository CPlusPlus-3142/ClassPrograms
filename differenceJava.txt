What differences did you notice so far between C++ and Java?

1. in C++ you include .h (header) files, while in Java you import the class
2. in Java all variables are on the stack and all objects are on the heap
   in C++ you can place objects on the stack and regular variable on the heap
   (you don't need to say 'new' to get an object)
3. << and >> in Java are bitwise shift while in C++ they are used for input, out
using cin and cout
4. in C++ you can use operators as functions on objects
   str[i], str1<str2           (operator overloading doesn't exist in Java)
5. C++ gives more direct access to memory (we still have to talk about this)
6. possibility of passing parameters by reference (&)
   in Java all parameters are passed-by-value
7. In Java, the compiler creates .class files that are portable across all
   platforms, while in C++ the compiler creates an executable specific to
   the machine that it compiled on.
8. In C++ there is more responsibility on the programmer.
9. There is no garbage collection, so the program has to
   be responsible to delete memory allocated with new.
10. with a regular array, the size must be known by compile time
int arr[SIZE];
11. in Java, an unitialized variable is a compiler error, not so in C++
12. in Java, objects and arrays are zeroed out. In C++ arrays are not initialized.
13. function declarations are needed in C++

some other differences:
- use #include instead import
- you must include <string> and in Java you don't have to
- in C++ you have templates and in Java they are called generics
