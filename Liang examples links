string class:  https://liveexample.pearsoncmg.com/liang/cpp3e/html/OrderTwoCities.html

we discussed:
1. allocating objects on the stack same as local var
2. you can immediately use the DOT operator to access the object's members
   example:
   string s;
   cout << s.length() << endl;
3. you can use the assignment operator to assign a string to another string
4. you can use all relational operators to compare strings
5. an uninitialized variable in C++ is not a compiler error, some
undefined value will be printed
